# System Design Notes
### How to evealuate system design -
- Simplicity 
- Fidelity : all the requirements are met
- Cost Effectiveness


### Parameters to evaluate :
| Params          | local       | cloud service |
| :---            |    :----:   |          ---: |
| simplicity      | lower       | Higher        |
| Fidelity        | Equivalent  |Equivalent     |
| Cost of Impl    |  Higher     | lower         |

### Cloud Service Providers :
- server
- serverless

### server Vs serverless :
| Params          | local       | cloud service |
| :---            |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Ease of use     | lower       |  Higher       |
| Efficiency      | Higher      |  lower        |
| Responsiveness  |  Higher     |  lower        |

### Latency and Throughput Definitions:

Latency: Time delay between initiating a request and receiving a response. Measures how quickly a single task or transaction is completed.

Throughput: Number of tasks or transactions processed in a given time period. Measures overall system capacity and performance.

Simple analogy:
- Latency = Speed of a single delivery truck
- Throughput = Total number of packages delivered by all trucks in a day

Key differences:
- Low latency means fast individual responses
- High throughput means processing many tasks simultaneously
