# Understanding Docker: From Basics to Advanced Concepts

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore Docker from its fundamental concepts to advanced features, including container orchestration and best practices.

## 1. Docker Overview

Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers can run consistently across different environments, making it easier to develop, ship, and run applications.

Key concepts:
- **Container**: A standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application
- **Image**: A template used to create containers
- **Registry**: A repository for storing and sharing Docker images
- **Dockerfile**: A script containing instructions to build a Docker image
