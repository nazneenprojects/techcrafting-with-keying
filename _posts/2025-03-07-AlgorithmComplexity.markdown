# Algorithm Complexity

## Prerequisites : Logarithm

Important Formula : A logarithm is the inverse of an exponential function, where the logarithm of a number is the exponent to which a base is raised to produce that number. 

```
If we have an equation in exponential form:

a^x = y

The equivalent logarithmic form is:

log_a(y) = x

```
